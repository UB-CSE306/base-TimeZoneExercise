# TimeZoneExercise

Run `make info` to list user-facing make targets

The file `timezone_2020.data` contains a little bit of time zone data from 2020.  If you want current data you can create an updated `.data` file and use that.

NOTES:
A time zone offset of -4 hours is entered as -400.
A time zone offset of -4 hours and 30 minutes is entered as -450 (50/100th of an hour).
